        "* Accepts text input from the user.\n",
        "* Automatically translates the input into English.\n",
        "* Displays the translated English text.\n",
        "* Simple and easy-to-use console-based interface.\n",

        "Introduces you to using APIs in Python.\n",
        "Helps you understand basic user input/output handling.\n",
